# DeFi Market Data Pipeline (TVL + Token Prices)

This project combines **DeFi market knowledge** with **Data Engineering best practices** to build a clean and modular ETL pipeline.  
The pipeline collects TVL and token price data directly from public APIs (DefiLlama & CoinGecko), transforms them into structured datasets, and prepares them for analysis or downstream modeling.

It is designed to simulate a real-world data workflow used in DeFi analytics, research, and protocol-level financial monitoring.

**Objectives

- Build a **realistic ETL pipeline** using Python.
- Extract **TVL data** from DefiLlama and **price data** from CoinGecko.
- Transform and merge both datasets into a unified, analysis-ready format.
- Structure the repository following **Data Engineering conventions**.
- Produce clean, reproducible output suitable for **market insights**, **risk analysis**, or **future dashboards**.
